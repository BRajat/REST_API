API'S - Application programming interface

Application - Relates to web application
             Programming Interface - The interface/connectivity between the two components of the web app (front end and back end)

Usage - In ETL data pipe line, the processed data needs to flow from the processing stage(the backend) to the web app(front end) and vice versa

Flask - used to create static python web application (static meaning - everytime the request are sent to the web server to execute, instead of 
dynamic response web app like one created with javascript)

Able to write API is must for data engineer. Understand the architecture the flow of data for various api calls. 
The API's are structured in well organised manner.

There is an end point associated with each part of the static web page. 
/ --> home page end point
/store/ --> stores end point [get(retrieve from store variable)]
/store/<string:name>/ --> store name end point [get(retrieve from store variable) and post(add to store variable)]
/store/<string:name>/item --> store [get and post]

5 api calls from above.
